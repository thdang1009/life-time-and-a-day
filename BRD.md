### 1. Project Overview & Vision

The goal is to create a digital sanctuary that commemorates the **1,314 days** of love between the two Stakeholders. The site will serve as a living timeline, starting from the spark of first love (**July 10, 2022**) to the sacred union (**December 24-25, 2024**) and beyond.

**The "Why":** To transform 1,314 days from a number into a narrative, ensuring the "Forever" promise is documented in the digital ether.

* **Milestone Highlighting:** Special focus on the wedding transition (from "Dating" to "Married").

---

### 3. Target Audience

* **Primary:** Your wife (The Surprise Factor).
* **Secondary:** Future versions of yourselves looking back on these early years.

> **BA Note:** To keep this at $0 cost, I recommend using **HTML/Tailwind CSS** or a **Notion-to-Website** tool. You don't need a database; the history is already written in your hearts—we just need to display it.
